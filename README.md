# Screen Actors Leeds Website

## 📸 Image Setup (Important)

For images to appear correctly on the live website and GitHub Pages, they must be placed in the **`public/images/`** folder.

**Do not** put images in a root `images` folder. Vite only looks inside `public` for static assets.

### Required File Structure
In your GitHub repository, ensure your files are here:

```
/public
  /images
    logo.png
    phil-photo.jpg
    kirkstall-exterior.jpg
    kirkstall-interior.jpg
    workshop-scene.jpg
    workshop-camera.jpg
    workshop-feedback.jpg
```

## 🚀 Running Locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` (Runs on port 8080)
