IMPORTANT: PLACE YOUR IMAGES IN THIS FOLDER

For your custom images to appear on the website, you must upload them to this folder (public/images/).

Please ensure your files are named exactly as follows to match the code:

1. logo.png              (Your logo)
2. phil-photo.jpg        (Photo for About page)
3. kirkstall-exterior.jpg (Location exterior)
4. kirkstall-interior.jpg (Location interior)
5. workshop-scene.jpg    (Workshop action shot 1)
6. workshop-camera.jpg   (Workshop action shot 2)
7. workshop-feedback.jpg (Workshop action shot 3)

Once these files are in this folder, the website will automatically show them instead of the internet placeholders.
